# Share an Idea

<div class="submission-hero">
  <p class="submission-hero__eyebrow">Community submission helper</p>
  <h2>Your experience is useful—even if you are brand new</h2>
  <p>Describe the problem in your own words. You do not need to know GitHub, write code, understand radio settings, or have a finished solution. The helper below turns what you know into a clear submission for the MeshCore Canada maintainers.</p>
</div>

!!! info "No GitHub account is needed"
    Review the prepared text, complete the anti-spam check if prompted, and select **Submit idea**. The helper creates a public review issue automatically.

!!! warning "Submissions are public"
    Do not include passwords, private channel keys, API tokens, exact home addresses, private coordinates, or anything else you would not post publicly. A city or broad region is enough.

## What happens next?

Maintainers will read the public issue, ask questions if something is unclear, and decide whether it belongs in the documentation, directory, tooling, or a future project. Submitting an idea does not guarantee implementation, but it makes the need visible and gives the community something concrete to discuss.

If you already know GitHub, you can also open the [Share a Community Idea form](https://github.com/MeshCore-ca/MeshCore-Canada/issues/new?template=community_idea.yml) directly.
